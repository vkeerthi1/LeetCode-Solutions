/*1672. Richest Customer Wealth
        You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
        A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.
        Example 1:

        Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
        Output: 6
        Explanation:
        1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
        2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
        Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
